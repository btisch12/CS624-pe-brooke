PE02 â€“ Core Components Mobile App
# Input
The user is prompted to enter their favorite course using a TextInput field. This allows the app to accept custom input from the user. Additionally, all course data (core, depth, and capstone) is hard-coded and visually presented to the user on screen. The image icon is sourced from the local assets folder and displayed at the top of the app.

# Process
The app is built using React Native with Expo, using core components such as View, Text, ScrollView, Image, TextInput, and StyleSheet. The input is stored in a state variable using the useState hook. Internal styles are applied to structure and format the layout, while ScrollView ensures content remains scrollable regardless of screen size.

# Output
The app outputs a clean, scrollable screen displaying all required courses in labeled sections. User input is displayed and stored in real-time, enhancing interaction and personalization.
