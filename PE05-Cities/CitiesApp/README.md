Analysis Report

This React Native app uses bottom tab and stack navigation to let users switch between four main features: viewing and adding cities, and viewing and adding countries. It’s built with @react-navigation/native and uses a bottom tab navigator to organize each section. The CitiesNav tab includes a stack navigator so users can go from the city list to a detailed view of a selected city. Cities and countries are stored in the app’s state, and users can add new ones through the AddCity and AddCountry tabs. The app passes data and functions like addCity, addLocation, and addCountry down to child components through props. When a user taps on a city, the app navigates to the City screen using stack navigation. To keep the console clean, it ignores some non-critical warnings using LogBox.ignoreLogs, and it uses a shared theme file to keep the UI consistent. Overall, it’s clean, organized, and easy to expand.
