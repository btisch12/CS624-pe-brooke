# PE01 - HelloWorld Mobile App

## Input  
The program does not require user input through forms or interactions. Instead, all necessary information—name, degree program, and school—is hardcoded directly within the code. These values are displayed as static text using React Native's `Text` component. 
## Process  
The app is built using React Native and Expo, structured under the Expo Router format. The `index.tsx` file in the `app` directory acts as the main screen. It uses a single `View` component to contain three `Text` components, each styled using a centralized `StyleSheet`. 

## Output  
The output is a simple mobile UI screen displaying my name, degree program, and school on a yellow background.
