Input
The program receives hardcoded user data as props to generate profile cards. Each card includes a name, title, description, and avatar image (provided via a local file using require). Six identical user profiles are rendered using a loop inside the main App component. These props are passed to the ProfileCard functional component.

Process
The ProfileCard component uses React Nativeâ€™s useState to manage whether the card is in a thumbnail or expanded state. When a user taps on a card (wrapped in TouchableHighlight), it toggles the state using immutability-helper. If showThumbnail is true, only the avatar is displayed. If false, the full profile with name, title, and description is shown. Flexbox is used to lay out all six cards responsively, allowing them to wrap in rows using flexWrap, justifyContent, and ScrollView for scrolling.

Output
The app displays six profile cards arranged in a grid. Tapping each card toggles between a small thumbnail view and a fully expanded profile view with detailed information.
